        <h3 class="centertext box"> ALL ABOUT TYANA</h3>
        <img src="portfolio-work/profilepicture.jpg" class="center boxL" width="20%">
        <p class= "fontsize">Tyana is a 21, almost 22-year (in May!!) old designer who resides in Toronto. She is currently in her 2nd
            year
            at George Brown
            College studying Interaction Design. After two years of being at York University and not knowing what
            she
            was
            doing in Computer Science and then Digital Media, she found the Interaction Design program and wanted to
            see
            what it had to offer. Thankfully, she is enjoying the program so far but wants to go further ahead and
            get
            her
            Bachelor's degree in anything she can. So this summer, she will be bridging into the Digital Experience Design
            program,
            also at George Brown College. Fingers crossed she will end up with her Bachelor's degree in hopes for a well paying
            job
            so
            she can move out of her parents house and begin her career.</p>
        <p class="fontsize"> From high school until now, Tyana has been coding since grade 10. She enjoys it very much and is still
            learning
            but has some beginner skills in the following: HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript and php. She continues to
            improve
            on
            these skills in hopes of becoming a better web designer and possibly and front-end developer. </p>
        <p class= "fontsize"> Aside from coding, she also is well versed in all things (this is a complete lie) design. Back to high
            school,
            she was in what was essentially a yearbook course with other assignments here and there. These
            courses
            are
            what sparked her interest in design and she wanted to see what she could make out of it. Her skills have
            improved since then and she has learned a lot over the past couple of years. Her knowledge for design
            includes
            the following programs: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, After Effects, Premiere and XD. She also
            has
            beginner experience working with 3D modelling programs like MAYA and Blender. </p>
        <p class="fontsize"> With this combined skillset, Tyana has no idea what she plans on doing for the future after getting her
            degree.
            But she hopes to *maybe and hopefully* become some sort of UI designer or Motion designer or 3D
            modelling
            artist
            because that is what she has enjoyed the most so far over the last two years of studying Interaction
            Design.
        </p>
        <p class="fontsize"> BUT IF ALL ELSE FAILS - she will go into trades and become an all-around the works esthetician/nail
            technician/hair stylist/eyelash technician. (only if she really can't make it but she belives in herself
            *somewhat*) </p>
